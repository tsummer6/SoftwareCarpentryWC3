# SoftwareCarpentryWC3
In this weeks lab for Software Carpentry, I have created a website using the built-in feature of GitHub, called “GitHub Pages”. Using a   fairly simple I first made a new repository, a website, and added that website to the repository. To visit a website should you choose to make one yourself: go to the website “USER.github.io/REPO”, where “USER” is your GitHub username, and “REPO” is the name of
your repository.
